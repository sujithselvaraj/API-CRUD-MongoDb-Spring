# API-CRUD-MongoDb-Spring


Before Creating the Project ,Make sure that you hve installed the Mongodb installed in your computer

Here i was using the mogodb community 6 and mongodb shell to verify my datas

You can also use the docker to make a container ,I too have attached the docker-compose.yaml file 
To install mongodb express and mongo ,you need to download the docker depending upon the environment of the system 
Go to the Terminal and cd to the docker-compose.yaml file folder 


and hit the command 
docker compose up -d

//this command used to detach the container in the docker and can run easily


Refer to the pom.xml for the dependencies and create the project in the 

https://start.spring.io
